This directory contains detailed documentation for the ShapeSaga project.

## Architecture Overview

ShapeSaga is a decentralized storytelling platform built on Shape Network that combines blockchain technology with AI-powered content generation.

### Core Components

1. **Smart Contracts** (Solidity)

   - StoryRegistry: Manages story creation and metadata
   - ContributionManager: Handles story contributions and branching
   - NFTMinter: Mints NFTs for stories and contributions
   - RewardSystem: Manages contributor rewards

2. **Frontend** (React + TypeScript)

   - User interface for creating and viewing stories
   - Wallet integration with Shape Network
   - AI content generation interface
   - Story visualization and navigation

3. **AI Integration**
   - Text generation using OpenAI GPT
   - Image generation for comics
   - Video generation for short narratives
   - Content moderation and quality checks

## Smart Contract Architecture

### StoryRegistry

- Central registry for all stories
- Manages story metadata and settings
- Handles story lifecycle (creation, updates, deactivation)
- Maintains reward pools for contributors

### ContributionManager

- Processes story contributions
- Manages approval workflows
- Handles story branching and alternative paths
- Community voting system for contributions

### NFTMinter

- Mints NFTs for original stories
- Mints NFTs for approved contributions
- Batch minting capabilities
- Metadata management via IPFS

### RewardSystem

- Calculates rewards based on engagement metrics
- Distributes rewards to contributors
- Quality-based bonus system
- Time decay for fairness

## Data Flow

1. **Story Creation**

   - User creates story with AI assistance
   - Metadata uploaded to IPFS
   - Story registered on blockchain
   - Reward pool can be established

2. **Contribution Process**

   - Users submit contributions/extensions
   - Optional approval process by story creator
   - Community voting on quality
   - Rewards calculated based on engagement

3. **NFT Minting**

   - Original creators can mint story NFTs
   - Contributors can mint contribution NFTs
   - Metadata stored on IPFS
   - Ownership tracked on blockchain

4. **Reward Distribution**
   - Engagement metrics tracked off-chain
   - Rewards calculated based on algorithm
   - Contributors claim rewards from smart contract
   - Quality bonuses for highly-rated content

## AI Integration

### Content Generation

- **Text**: OpenAI GPT for story extensions
- **Images**: DALL-E/Stable Diffusion for comic panels
- **Video**: Text-to-video models for short clips

### Quality Control

- Content moderation for inappropriate material
- Coherence checking for story continuity
- Style consistency across contributions

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security

- OpenZeppelin contracts for standard functionality
- Reentrancy guards on financial functions
- Pausable contracts for emergency stops
- Owner-only administrative functions

### Frontend Security

- Environment variable protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure wallet connection handling
- HTTPS enforcement

## Deployment Guide

- Node.js 18+
- MetaMask or compatible wallet
- Shape Network testnet tokens
- API keys for AI services

### Contract Deployment

1. Configure environment variables
2. Compile contracts: `npm run compile`
3. Run tests: `npm run test`
4. Deploy to testnet: `npm run deploy:testnet`
5. Verify contracts on explorer

### Frontend Deployment

1. Update contract addresses in environment
2. Configure AI service API keys
3. Build application: `npm run build`
4. Deploy to hosting service

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
